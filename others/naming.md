## Keywords

This is a list of reserved keywords in C++. Since they are used by the language, these keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading.

	Eg. if, else, while, for, do, enum, new, void, int, auto, bool etc.

## Identifiers

Within a program names are used to designate variables and functions. The following
rules apply when creating names, which are also known as identifiers:

 - Names can contain letters, digits and underscores.
 - Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_).
 - Names are case sensitive (`myVar`  and  `myvar`  are different variables).
 - Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
 - Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as  `int`) cannot be used as names.

## Naming Convention

In C++ we use CamelCase for all names.
Eg myVariable
