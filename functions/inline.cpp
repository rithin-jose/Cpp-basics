/*
    When an inline function is called, the compiler replaces 
    all the calling statements with the function definition 
    at run-time. Every time an inline function is called, 
    the compiler generates a copy of the functionâ€™s code, 
    in place, to avoid the function call.


    Inline function reduces the overhead caused by the function call.

    Disadvantage is that when the function is called multiple times the 
    program becomes bulky.
