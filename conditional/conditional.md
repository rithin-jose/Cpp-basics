## Conditional statement

There come situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we decide what should we do next. Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions we will execute the next block of code.

example if a is greater than b print the value of a else print the value of b.

types of conditional statements:

 - if-else statements
	 -  if
	 - if-else
	 - if-else-if
	 - nested if
 - Switch statement
 - Jump statement
 	 -  break
 	 - goto
