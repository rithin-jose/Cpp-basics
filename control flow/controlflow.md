## Loop

A Loops in programming come into use when we need to repeatedly execute a block of statements

There are mainly two types of loops:

1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this type of loops the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop are entry controlled loops.

2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this type of loops the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute atleast once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. do â€“ while loop is exit controlled loop.


Parts of a loop are 
1.   **Initialization Expression**: In this expression we have to initialize the loop counter to some value. for example: int i=1;
2.   **Test Expression**: In this expression we have to test the condition. If the condition evaluates to true then we will execute the body of loop and go to update expression otherwise we will exit from the for loop. For example: i <= 10;
3.   **Update Expression**: After executing loop body this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value. for example: i++;
